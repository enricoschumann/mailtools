v0.1-7  (????-??-??; not yet released)

  o sendmail: new arguments 'display.only', 'html' and
    'SendUsingAccount' (the latter a result of
    https://github.com/enricoschumann/mailtools/issues/1
    and
    https://github.com/enricoschumann/mailtools/issues/2 ;
    thanks to 'TobiSonne' for raising these issues)

  o sendmail: if 'body.file' is specified for method
    "outlook", the file is now read via PowerShell's
    'Get-Content'. Before, long message bodies would
    raise an error because of a character limitation of
    PowerShell's command length.

  o new function "save_msg_attachments"
