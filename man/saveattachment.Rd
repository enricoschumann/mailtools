  Save E-Mail Attachment
}
\description{
  Save an e-mail attachment to a file.
}
\usage{
saveAttachment(pattern, fname, writeIfExists = TRUE, adjustfn = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{pattern}{
    the attachment to find. Can be a regular expression.
}
  \item{fname}{
the mbox file
}
  \item{writeIfExists}{
    logical
}
  \item{adjustfn}{
    default is \code{TRUE}: adjust filenames on Windows? 
}

}
\details{
  
  The function is currently only tested with mbox files (which is the
  format that Thunderbird uses, or the format of \code{nnfolders} in
  Gnus (\url{http://www.gnus.org/}). The function will load the whole
  mbox file into memory, which may not work very well if the file is
  large.

}
\value{
  
  The function is called for its side effect. It returns a character
  vector of matched attachment names.
